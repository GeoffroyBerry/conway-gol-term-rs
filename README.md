# Some Conway's Game Of Life

I made this game as a way to learn rust, no further progress on the project is intended.

The game runs in the terminal and was made in rust

It should work on almost all OS terminals but was only tested on ubuntu 20.04 

You can load files or generate the game from a string

While it's playing you can move the "camera" around and alter the speed

### Epilepsy Warning
The terminal might be "flashing" which may not be suitable for photosensitive epilepsy.

### Running
Use the following command to start
> cargo run --release
